The permanent collection of around 5,000 works (up from 1,100 works at the time of the museums opening in 1995) dates from the mid-20th century onward.

    content: 'Neil Albertí, born in Sant Feliu de Guíxols, Catalonia, in 1975. In 1992 he moves to Barcelona, where for three years he combines his studies of gemmology with a job in the domain of the gemstones. In 1998 he decides to make a radical change in his life and enters the world of sculpture by signing up into some forging and casting courses in La Bisbal Ceramic School. In this rural environment is where his passion for sculpture is born, a passion that, as he himself says: goes beyond the act of creating, it moves even to my lifestyle His interest in mastering the domain of volume takes him to the School of Arts and Crafts in Vic, a city where he lives for four years. The following years, and moved by a greater creative anxiety, he discovers, learns and develops his work through multiple techniques as ceramics, forging, welding, casting, moulding, wax, chalk or stone. During this period he holds some exhibitions in Barcelona, Madrid and France, among other places. In 2006 he returns to Sant Feliu de Guíxols. It is at that very moment that one of the consistent features of his work is born: immediacy, fluidity in execution, guiding himself by the moment, involving the materials and the subconscious at the time of creation. His main interest is the understanding of a base with the different materials and tools used in sculpture, keeping with them a fluent dialogue, with the minimum number of limitations and time. Due to its ductility, iron becomes his most faithful companion for the next four years. Since 2009, driven by curiosity and with a more and more strong work, without leaving behind his interest by space and volume, he starts rethinking physical capacity, colour or light in sculpture. He also becomes interested in the time factor, and with fabrics and yarns as new supports, he reinvents his concept of sculpture, by taking it to the extreme of what is immovable, fully entering into the world of installations. Immersed in a yearning for turning up even the most sacred idea, he plays and explores constantly through discussion with all the corners of full and empty, of volume, of what is real, of what is imaginary, worldly or irrational. Just like he tells about his last work: Directed chance, measured unconscious, sensed surprise, calmed immediacy… These nearly opposing concepts, whose balance ─starting from the percentages of its base─ I have to handle, are the very foundations of my last work.Leaving until the last second the possibility to change the direction of the work by keeping up mystery, anxiety, fear and the joy of creating at the expense of the moment; and, through the space where sculpture inhabits, the space it generates and/or conforms, and the movement caused by the occupation of the space, make them the key items of my research as a sculptor, hand in hand with my research as an individual self.

    content: 'Spanish, b. 1985, Tenerife, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain, based in Tenerife, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain. He was brought up in an urban area and exposed to street art early in his life. He first picked a paint can when he was a 16-year-old teenager, then living in Tenerife. His first experience with street art consisted in tagging a flyover with a group of friends. Joel is currently living in Dawlish, UK, where most of his street pieces can be found. Joel has always been a creative person who liked drawing, but never took art seriously until very recently. He has been living from his art since approximately 2010.',

    content: 'This introductory art course teaches students how to draw, covering: perspective, shapes and shadows, pencil, pen and ink drawing, use of charcoal, coloured pencils, pastels and chalk, how to draw people and how to sketch. This is an excellent starting point for people who simply want to draw well. If it is likely you will want to learn to paint as well you could consider the B2 Beginner’s Painting course, although students who are likely to take both the Beginners Drawing course and the Beginners Painting course should consider taking D1 our Drawing & Painting Diploma course. The Drawing and Painting Diploma covers the same areas, as well as much more besides, and offers very good value.',

    content: 'Catchy is a Masterclasses program in Photography. The workshops we provide are exclusively led by distinguished photographers. They are held monthly and are open to professional photographers and advanced amateurs. After the workshop, Catchy website features the participants portfolios, video interviews and a review by a photography expert. Catchy also provides a mentoring service which purpose is to put in touch photographers and experts in order to help improve their photographic approach. After 5 years of working in the new media technology sector in Spain, Andrea Molino decided to change her career direction. In 2008 she enrolled in a special program for Arts Administration at New York University. She then was in charge of developing multimedia clients for the prestigious Magnum Photo archive. Today she is the founder and director of Catchy. I had the opportunity to work in the heart of the photography industry for a few years and what I saw was not only an industry in great turmoil but also one that was becoming ever more popular, which at first glance gives off a strange sense of ambiguity. The internet and the different photo applications that exist are opening this art to the public, more and more photographs are being taken and there is more interest in photography than ever before. The proof is not only the exponential quantity of photographs online but also in galleries, museum exhibitions, as well as in public and private spaces.',

    content: 'Pedro Balarias examines the systems and networks that underwrite her daily life. Born and raised in Tehran, she dissects, interrogates and recasts everyday objects and events to draw out their relationships to the contemporary Iranian experience. She reveals the inner workings of a social system by taking apart its components before reassembling them to uncover collective assumptions and their underlying rules of engagement.  Her work is characterised by an emphasis on research and analysis that is a legacy of her design background, as well as by her continued engagement with critical theory. Her mode of working covers diverse media—video, 3D printed models, municipal murals and drawings—and subjects as varied as automated telephone systems, American security policy, the memories associated with a family house, and the patterns of Persian carpets.  Ansarinias practice is sited upon the fraught faultline between the private realm and its wider socioeconomic context. Even as its concerns have shifted from the intimacy of domesticity to an interest in the built environment, it has maintained an engagement with physicality and materiality. Still, the traces of lived experience—of owners, of residents—remain important. As a whole, the works explore how local iterations of a culture might act as a fulcrum and flashpoint for the hopes and fears of people living in an increasingly, albeit asymmetrically, globalised world.  Born in 1979 in Tehran, Pedro Balarias graduated from the London College of Communication in 2001 before taking a Master of Fine Arts at the California College of the Arts (CCA) in San Francisco in 2003.  ',
